# Resume_classification
This project includes collection of resumes of various departments. Then the dictionary (corpus) is built which is automated (no input is given manually). After getting the dictionary for each department, we then pass a new resume which is classified as one of the branches. It tells us how well a resume is belonging to a particular branch/field.  Technology stack: Natural Language Processing, Deep Neural Networks

The present working files are Word_to_Test.py and ResumeClassification.py
We are trying another approach which is still ongoing and present in NLP_Extraction.py
